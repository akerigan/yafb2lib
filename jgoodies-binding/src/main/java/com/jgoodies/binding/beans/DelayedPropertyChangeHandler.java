/**
 * A PropertyChangeListener that is intended to handle property changes
 * after a specified delay. Useful to defer changes until a stable state
 * is reached. For example if you look up a persistent object for a selection
 * in a list. You don't want to find and transport objects that the user
 * selects temporarily; you want to get only a stable selection.
 * Or if you want to validate on every key typed, you may delay the
 * validation until no key has been typed for a given time.<p>
 * 
 * If this handler is notified about a property change it stores 
 * the PropertyChangeEvent it has received in <code>#propertyChange</code>, 
 * and starts a Swing Timer that will call <code>#delayedPropertyChange</code> 
 * after a delay. In coalescing mode a previously started timer - if any - 
 * will be stopped before. In other words, the timer is restarted.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Write about the recommended delay time - above the double-click time
 * and somewhere below a second, e.g. 100ms to 200ms.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Summarize the differences between the DelayedReadValueModel, the
 * DelayedWriteValueModel, and this DelayedPropertyChangeHandler.
