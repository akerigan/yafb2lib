/**
 * Combines the {@link List} and {@link ListModel} interfaces.
 * Implementations can be used to bind lists to list-based
 * user interface components like <code>JList</code>, <code>JTable</code>
 * and <code>JComboBox</code>.<p>
 * 
 * The JGoodies Data Binding ships with two predefined implementations:
 * <code>ArrayListModel</code> and <code>LinkedListModel</code>.<p>
 * 
 * See also the class comment in {@link SelectionInList} that discusses
 * the advantages you gain if you add <code>ListModel</code> capabilities
 * to a <code>List</code>.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Check if this type is really necessary; remove it if obsolete.
 * Without doubt the ObservableList implementations are really useful,
 * among others the predefined ArrayListModel and LinkedListModel.
 * It's just that these implementations are typically used as List
 * and exposed as ListModel, and so there may be no need for the ObservableList
 * interface.
