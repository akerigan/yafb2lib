/**
 * An abstract class that minimizes the effort required to implement 
 * a type converter. A type converter is a ValueModel that converts the type 
 * of an object being held as a value in one ValueModel into another type.<p>
 *  
 * More formally, a converting ValueModel <i>VM1</i> converts the type 
 * <i>T2</i> of an object being held as a value in one ValueModel <i>VM2</i> 
 * into another type <i>T1</i>. When reading a value from VM1, 
 * instances of T2 are read from VM2 and are converted to T1. When storing 
 * a new value to VM1, the type converter will perform the inverse conversion
 * and will convert an instance of T1 to T2.<p>
 * 
 * The conversion must be performed when reading and writing values,
 * as well as in the change notification. This class specifies abstract
 * methods for the conversion from source to output, which is used to
 * convert in <code>#getValue</code> and in the change notification. 
 * For the write conversion you must implement <code>#setValue</code>.<p>
 * 
 * Most converters can set values converted by <code>#convertFromSubject</code> 
 * with <code>#setValue</code>. However, a converter may reject subject values 
 * to be converted and may reject values to be set - as any ValueModel.<p>
 * 
 * Type converters should be used judiciously and only to bridge two 
 * <code>ValueModel</code>s. Converters often use a generic but weak 
 * conversion, and so can be limited w.r.t. to localized 
 * formatting conventions.<p>
 * 
 * When binding non-String values to a text UI component, consider
 * using a {@link javax.swing.JFormattedTextField}. Formatted text fields 
 * provide a powerful means to convert strings to objects and handle many cases 
 * that arise around invalid input. Formatted text fields can be bound
 * to <code>ValueModel</code>s using the 
 * {@link com.jgoodies.binding.beans.PropertyConnector} class.
