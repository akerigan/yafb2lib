/**
 * A ValueModel that deferres updates and read-access for a specified delay.
 * Useful to coalesce frequent changes. For example if a heavy computation
 * shall be performed only for a "stable" selection after a series of
 * quick selection changes.<p>
 * 
 * Wraps a given subject ValueModel and observes subject value changes
 * and forwards them to listeners of this model after a delay. If the subject 
 * value changes, a Swing Timer is used to delay the change notification. 
 * A previously started timer - if any - will be stopped before.
 * Reading this model's value returns:
 *  a) the subject value if there's no pending update, or 
 *  b) this model's old value that will be updated after the delay.
 * If a value is set to this model, it immediately updates the subject value.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Describe how and when listeners get notified about the delayed change.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Write about the recommended delay time - above the double-click time
 * and somewhere below a second, e.g. 100ms to 200ms.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Write about a slightly different commit handling. The current 
 * implementation defers the commit until the value is stable for the 
 * specified delay; it's a DelayUntilStableForXXXmsValueModel. Another
 * feature is to delay for a specified time but ensure that some commits
 * and change notifications happen. The latter is a CoalescingWriteValueModel.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Summarize the differences between the DelayedReadValueModel, the
 * DelayedWriteValueModel, and the DelayedPropertyChangeHandler.
