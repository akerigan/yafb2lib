/**
 * A ValueModel implementation that is intended to be used as trigger channel 
 * for instances of BufferedValueModel. API users shall trigger commit and flush 
 * events using <code>#triggerCommit</code> and <code>#triggerFlush</code>.<p>
 * 
 * This Trigger class works around an inconvenient situation when using
 * a general ValueHolder as trigger channel of a BufferedValueModel. 
 * BufferedValueHolder performs commit and flush events only if the trigger 
 * channel value reports a change. And a ValueHolder doesn't report a change 
 * if <code>#setValue</code> tries to set the current value. For example
 * if you set <code>Boolean.TRUE</code> twice, the latter doesn't fire 
 * a property change event. The methods <code>#triggerCommit</code> and 
 * <code>#triggerFlush</code> check for the current state and guarantee
 * that the appropriate <code>PropertyChangeEvent</code> is fired. 
 * On the other hand, the implementation minimizes the number of events 
 * necessary to commit or flush buffered values.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Constraints:</strong> The value is of type <code>Boolean</code>.
 * <p>
 * The following example delays the commit of a buffered value:
 * <pre>
 * ValueModel subject = new ValueHolder();
 * Trigger trigger = new Trigger();
 * BufferedValueModel buffer = new BufferedValueModel(subject, trigger);
 * 
 * buffer.setValue("value");
 * ...
 * trigger.triggerCommit();
 * </pre>
