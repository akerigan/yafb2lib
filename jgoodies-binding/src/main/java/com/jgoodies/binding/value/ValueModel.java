package com.jgoodies.binding.value;

import java.beans.PropertyChangeListener;

/**
 * Describes models with a generic access to a single value that allow
 * to observe value changes. The value can be accessed using the 
 * <code>#getValue()</code>/<code>#setValue(Object)</code> methods.
 * Observers can register instances of <code>PropertyChangeListener</code> 
 * to be notified if the value changes.<p>
 * 
 * If the value is read-only or write-only, an implementor may choose
 * to reject an operation using an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> 
 * or may do nothing or perform an appropriate action, or may return an
 * appropriate value.<p>
 * 
 * The listeners registered with this ValueModel using #addValueChangeListener
 * will be invoked only with PropertyChangeEvents that have the name set to 
 * "value". 
 * In other words, the listeners won't get notified when a PropertyChangeEvent 
 * is fired that has a null object as the name to indicate an arbitrary set 
 * of the event source's properties have changed. This is the case 
 * if you use the PropertyChangeSupport, either directly or indirectly, 
 * to fire property changes with the property name "value" specified.
 * This constraint ensures that all ValueModel implementors behave 
 * like the AbstractValueModel subclasses. 
 * In the rare case, where you want to notify a PropertyChangeListener
 * even with PropertyChangeEvents that have no property name set,
 * you can register the listener with #addPropertyChangeListener,
 * not #addValueChangeListener.<p>
 *
 * AbstractValueModel minimizes the effort required to implement this interface. 
 * It uses the PropertyChangeSupport to fire PropertyChangeEvents, and it adds 
 * PropertyChangeListeners for the specific property name "value". This ensures
 * that the constraint mentioned above is met.<p>
 * 
 * Implementors are encouraged to provide non-null values for the 
 * PropertyChangeEvent's old and new values. However, both may be null.
