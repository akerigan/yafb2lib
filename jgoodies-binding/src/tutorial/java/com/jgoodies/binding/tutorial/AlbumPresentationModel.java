/**
 * In addition to its superclass this class provides a bound
 * read-only property <em>composerEnabled</em> that is true
 * if and only if the underlying Album is non-<code>null</code> and classical.
 * This property is intended to be used by a variety of presentation properties,
 * not just a component's <em>enabled</em> state. You can enable or disable 
 * a composer presentation, or switch a composer field's <em>editable</em> 
 * property, or to hide and show a larger composer editor section.<p>
 * 
 * I've added the <em>composerEnabled</em> property primarily for learning 
 * and demonstration purposes. And I wanted to closely follow the example 
 * used in Martin Fowler's description of the 
 * <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">Presentation
 * Model</a> pattern. This example shows how "raw" domain object properties
 * can be aggregated or filtered by the presentation model layer for use in 
 * the presentation layer. In cases where there's a direct mapping between
 * a raw property and the aggregated property used in the UI, it may be easier
 * to observe the raw property. But if this mapping becomes more complex 
 * an aggregated property is recommended.<p>
 * 
 * Note that a UI that buffers the classical property cannot use 
 * <em>composerEnabled</em> but requires a separate aggregated property, 
 * for example <em>bufferedComposerEnabled</em>. To keep this code close
 * to Fowler's original, I've implemented this feature in a subclass, see 
 * {@link com.jgoodies.binding.tutorial.manager.BufferedAlbumPresentationModel}.
 * The buffered composer enabled property is an example where the eager 
 * property aggregation adds overhead and complexity, and it may turn out
 * that using the buffered classical property would be easier to understand.
